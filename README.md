Using Videogular together with ionic in a simple project


This was a test if I can get videogular working within a cordova / ionic project. Actually it worked on an android 4.4 phone.

If you want to build the project, you need to
* add the android plattform: <code>ionic platform add android</code>
* build the project  <code>ionic build</code>
* run the project <code>ionic run</code>

execute all commands at project root level.

Installed software which is needed:
* apache cordova
* ionic
